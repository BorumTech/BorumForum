We are a little bit different from Semantic Versioning, here's how:

- There is no public API
- Starting [November 13, 2019](https://borumer.github.io/countdowns/Borum1stAnniversary.html) releases are by COMMIT or BRANCH, released Sunday evening

## Rules for Versioning

1. MAJOR RELEASE: Huge change to a user interface
2. MINOR RELEASE: New feature
3. PATCH: Bug fix
1. A minor release MAY contain patches
2. A major release MAY contain minor releases and patches

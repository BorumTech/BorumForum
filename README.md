# Preventing SQL Injection to Secure Databases

This project uses PHP, MySQL, and SQL to create a website that is not vulnerable to SQL Injection. The project uses functions such as `mysqli_real_escape_string()` and `urlencode()` to deal with hacking techniques designed to alter, destroy, expose, or exploit the database. 

# bforborum

Borum/bforborum is the extension to the above project. Now that I have extensive knowledge of PHP, I can create a secure website while accomplishing another task - in this case a forum. Borum is a Q&A Community for categories starting with Bor- or rhyming with bore, mainly on Boron. The user can navigate Borum like it is a regular, professional website through the sitemap header at the top. The urls are user-friendly using the .htaccess file in the root directory. 

# Open Source

There is yet another branch to the Borum project. And that is the open source aspect to this. As this is my first project that might actually attract people to contribute to it and use it due to its real-world-applicable nature, I am welcoming open-source. That means pull requests, issues, and feedback.

# Directory Organization

CSS makes the page look better and more stylish, and the JavaScript makes it more interactive. The styles are written in css and can be found in the css folder. The databases are written in sql and are found in the databases folder. The images are jpgs, jpegs, gifs, or pngs and can be found in the images folder. The pages are HTML and PHP pages. Within the pages is the includes folder. This is made up of the files that all pages use as a template. The documents are .txt and markdown documents for information. The JavaScript files can be found in the scripts folder.

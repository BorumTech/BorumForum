# Preventing SQL Injection to Secure Databases

This project uses PHP, MySQL, and SQL to create a website that is not vulnerable to SQL Injection. The project uses functions such as `mysqli_real_escape_string()` and `urlencode()` to deal with hacking techniques designed to alter, destroy, expose, or exploit the database.

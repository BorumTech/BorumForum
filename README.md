# Preventing SQL Injection to Secure Databases

This project uses PHP, MySQL, and SQL to create a website that is not vulnerable to SQL Injection. CSS makes the page look better and more stylish, and the JavaScript makes it more interactive. The styles are written in css and can be found in the css folder. The databases are written in sql and are found in the databases folder. The images are jpgs, jpegs, gifs, or pngs and can be found in the images folder. The pages are HTML and PHP pages. Within the pages is the includes folder. This is made up of the files that all ages use as a template. The documents are .txt and markdown documents for information. The JavaScript files can be found in the scripts folder.
